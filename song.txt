I saw you there, looking so good tonight
I swear to God, I'm dying to kiss you
My heart, bebé, it's beating so, so fast
I didn't know how much that I need you

You're getting closer, and now my legs just started shaking
Would be delicious to have a taste of you right now
If I could try, it would make me so psychotic
For that addiction, I would need a rehab

Papacito, ay, qué rico tú
I want you and not just for a little
Touching your body is my desire, uh
Please don't be mad si me le robo un besito
